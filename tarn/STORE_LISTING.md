NOTES FOR REVIEW

Data Protection Feature: The app includes automatic data deletion after multiple failed PIN attempts. This is similar to Apple's own "Erase Data after 10 failed attempts" feature in iOS Settings > Face ID & Passcode. This protects user health data if a device is lost or stolen.

Privacy: This app makes zero network requests. All data is stored locally and encrypted. We do not collect any user data.

Icon Switching: Users can change the app icon to a generic calculator, notes, or weather icon for discretion. This is a privacy feature using the standard iOS alternate icons API.
